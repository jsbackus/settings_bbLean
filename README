This repository contains the settings files that I use for bbLean, a variant of
BB4Win. To use this config, first install bbLean then clone this repository
into the bbLean install directory. i.e. if you install to C:\bbLean, then clone
into a temporary directory, move the .git directory into C:\bbLean and do a
"git pull" to populate.

bbLean can be found at:
